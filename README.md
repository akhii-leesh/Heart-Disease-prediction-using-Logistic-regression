# Heart-Disease-prediction-using-Logistic-regression

trying out logistic regression and finding out the chances of heart disease and defects based on variety of factors...

About the dataset:

Age
Sex : male : 1
female : 0

chest pain type
-- Value 1: typical angina
-- Value 2: atypical angina
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain
-- Value 4: asymptomatic

resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital

serum cholestoral in mg/dl

(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

resting electrocardiographic results

-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.
It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest.

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

--Value 1: upsloping
-- Value 2: flat
-- Value 3: downsloping

vessels colored by flourosopy : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

Target : 0 No Heart disease
1 Heart disease
